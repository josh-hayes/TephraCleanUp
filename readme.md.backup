# Assessing clean-up volumes for municipal areas following tephra fall
Python code to estimate the volume of tephra municipalities may need to remove following tephra fall. The model is based upon the model presented in [Hayes et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13617-016-0052-3) and uses OpenStreetMap data to estimate urban surfaces and consequently volumes of tephra to remove.

## Libraries/packages
* [OSMnX](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) - Version 0.16.0
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/) - Version 1.19.1
* [MatPlotLib](https://matplotlib.org/) - Version 3.3.2
* [Geopandas](https://geopandas.org/) - Version 0.8.1
* [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) - Version 1.5.0

## Set-up and Run

### Data
The model requires the following data to run:  

* StudyCities.txt - A list of cities of interest to run the model at
* CitiesThickness.csv - A csv file containing the locations and the respective tephra thickness (mm) for each scenario of interest.
* CitiesInfo.csv - A csv file that contains information relating to the population, area, and population density of each city of interest. This is used when a boundary is not identified within the OSM data to calculate an estimated urban extent. If data does not need to be downloaded from OSM, this file is not necessary


### To run the model for a single city
1. Add the city's name to the "StudyArea.txt" file.
2. Ensure the "CitiesThickness.csv" is present and complete (see example for Southeast Asia)
2. Run "TephraCleanUp.py". 


### To run for multiple cities
1. Add cities of interest to the "StudyCities.txt"
2. Ensure that the "CitiesThickness.csv" and "Cities_info.csv" file are present
3. Run "IterateCleanUp.py"


## Example
We include data to run the model for a number of cities and eruption scenarios for Southeast Asia. A worked example scenario can be found in the associated Jupyter notebook.

## Features
* Estimates the volume of tephra municipal authorities may need to remove following volcanic eruptions
* Automatically pulls OpenStreetMap data for cities of interest.

To do list:  

* Integrate geospatial functionality for using tephra isopachs and raster files to automate the tephra thickness assignment process. 

## Status
Project is: in progress
