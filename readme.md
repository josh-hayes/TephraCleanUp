# Assessing clean-up volumes for municipal areas following tephra fall
Python code to estimate the volume of tephra municipalities may need to remove following tephra fall. The model is based upon the model presented in [Hayes et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13617-016-0052-3) and uses OpenStreetMap data to estimate urban surfaces and consequently volumes of tephra to remove.
